          This dataset provides detailed records of shipments, including
          Shipment ID, Date, Origin, Destination, Product ID, Quantity, Supplier
          ID, and Transport Mode. It captures the movement of goods across
          various global locations, specifying the type of transport usedâ€”either
          Sea or Air. This information is crucial for tracking shipment
          logistics, managing supply chain operations, and analyzing
          transportation efficiency.
